## Project Overview
VRoom is a virtual reality (VR) platform designed to enhance remote collaboration and learning. By leveraging the immersive experience of VR, users can connect in a shared virtual space to communicate, visualize, and interact in ways that traditional video conferencing cannot offer.

## Objective
The primary objective of VRoom is to create an accessible, intuitive, and feature-rich virtual environment where users can:
- Collaborate on projects or ideas as if they were in the same physical space.
- Conduct dynamic presentations and workshops with interactive elements.
- Foster a sense of presence and connection among remote team members or learners.

## Features
VRoom includes the following key features:
- **Room Connection**: Users can easily join a shared virtual space using a unique room ID.
- **Interactive Whiteboard**: A 3D drawing tool that allows users to sketch ideas and share visual concepts in real-time.
- **Pointing and Interaction**: Utilizing VR controllers, users can point at objects, navigate menus, and interact with the virtual environment through raycasting.
- **Slide Projection**: Users can upload and display slides within the virtual room, facilitating presentations and educational sessions.
- **Voice Communication**: Integrated voice chat enables clear and seamless communication among participants, with spatial audio to enhance the sense of presence.

## Technologies Used
VRoom is built using a combination of cutting-edge technologies:
- **WebRTC**: For real-time communication and data exchange.
- ****: A WebGL library for rendering 3D graphics in the browser.
- ****: A web framework for building virtual reality experiences.
- ****: Utilized for room management, data storage, and hosting.

## Benefits
- **Enhanced Collaboration**: Provides a more engaging and effective way for teams to work together remotely.
- **Accessibility**: Accessible from anywhere, requiring only a VR headset and internet connection.
- **Scalability**: Easily scalable to accommodate small teams or large groups in a single virtual space.
- **Immersive Learning**: Offers an immersive platform for education and training, making complex concepts easier to understand.
