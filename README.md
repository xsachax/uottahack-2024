## Project project

VRoom is a virtual reality (VR) platform designed to enhance remote collaboration and learning. By leveraging the immersive experience of VR, users can connect in a shared virtual space to communicate, visualize, and interact in ways that traditional video conferencing cannot offer.

## Objective

The primary objective of VRoom is to create an accessible, intuitive, and feature-rich virtual environment where users can:
- Collaborate on projects or ideas as if they were in the same physical space.
- Conduct dynamic presentations and workshops with interactive elements.
- Foster a sense of presence and connection among remote team members or learners.

## Features

VRoom includes the following key features:
- **Room Connection**: Users can easily join a shared virtual space using a unique room ID.
- **Interactive Whiteboard**: A 3D drawing tool that allows users to sketch ideas and share visual concepts in real-time.
- **Pointing and Interaction**: Utilizing VR controllers, users can point at objects, navigate menus, and interact with the virtual environment through raycasting.
- **Slide Projection**: Users can upload and display slides within the virtual room, facilitating presentations and educational sessions.
- **Voice Communication**: Integrated voice chat enables clear and seamless communication among participants, with spatial audio to enhance the sense of presence.

## Technologies Used

VRoom is built using a combination of cutting-edge technologies:
- **[Unity VR](https://unity.com/solutions/vr)**: A cross-platform game engine used as the platform for virtual reality development.
- **[C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language))**: A flexible, object-oriented general purpose programming language ideal for virtual reality development.
- **[Mirror Networking](https://mirror-networking.com/)**: An open-source netoworking extension for Unity, used for room connections.
- **[OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api)**: Used for quering a GPT model for responses.
